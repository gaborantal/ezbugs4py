John made a list of people he wanted to invite for Halloween, but he accidentally wrote down some people's names three
times. Help him find these names.

Write the `threetimes` function, which takes a string as a parameter. The received text should be interpreted as a list,
where the names are separated by commas and each comma is followed by a space. The function's task is to return a list
of those names that appear **exactly three times** in the original text. If none of the names appear three times, return
an empty list.
