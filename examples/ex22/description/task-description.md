Kate made a list of people she wanted to invite for Halloween, but she accidentally wrote down some people's names
twice. Help her find the duplicate names.

Write the `twice` function, which takes a string as a parameter. The received text should be interpreted as a list where
the names are separated by commas and each comma is followed by a space. The function's task is to return a list of
names that appear **exactly twice** in the original text. If none of the names appear twice, return an empty list.
