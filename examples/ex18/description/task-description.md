## Match results

Write a function named `match_results` that expects a list of strings as a parameter. The strings contain match results separated by semicolons in the following format: `home_team;away_team;result`, where the result is, for example, `5-1`. The function should sum up the goals scored by the teams based on the results into a dictionary. The keys should be the team names, and the values should be the number of goals scored.
Return the completed dictionary.
