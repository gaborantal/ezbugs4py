## Study Average

Write a function called `average` that takes a text as a parameter containing integers separated by commas! The function
should return the average of the numbers in the text, but only consider digits 2 through 5 in the average calculation!

If the function receives a parameter that is not of string type or an empty string (text of length 0), the return value
should be the number `-1`.
