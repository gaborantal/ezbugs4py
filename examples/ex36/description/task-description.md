## Mode

Write a function named `mode` that takes a text containing integers separated by semicolons as a parameter. The function
should return the mode of the numbers in the text, i.e., the most frequently occurring number. If multiple numbers occur
the same number of times in the input, return the **earlier** occurring number!

If the function receives a parameter that is not of string type, or the parameter is an empty string (text with a length
of 0), then the return value should be `-99`.
