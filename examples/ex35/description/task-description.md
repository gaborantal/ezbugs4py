### Proportion

Write a function named `proportion` that takes a text and a letter as parameters. The function should return the ratio
of occurrences of the given letter in the text.
If the function receives a parameter that is not of string type, or the parameter is an empty string (text with a length
of 0), or the specified letter (second parameter) is more than one character long, then the return value should be `-1`.
