## Word Counting

Create a function named `word_count` that expects a textual data as a parameter and returns a dictionary showing how
many times each word occurred in the text.

Subtasks:

- Check whether the function parameter is indeed of string type. If not, return an empty dictionary.
- Transform the input data into words along whitespace boundaries (any whitespace).
- The dictionary should only contain unique words, and for each unique word, the dictionary's value field should
  indicate its occurrence in the input data.
