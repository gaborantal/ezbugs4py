## Combinations of N Elements of Kth Class

Create a function named `k_combination` that returns the combinations of N elements of Kth class for positive integers N
and K.

Subtasks:

- The function parameters are N and K, respectively.
- Check whether the function parameters are indeed positive integers, and N > K is true. Otherwise, return zero.
- Mathematical formula: `n! / k!(n-k)!`
- **Hint**: There is no need to import anything, and the calculation of factorial involves the product of integers from
  1 to n, inclusive.
