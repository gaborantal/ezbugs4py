## Palindromes

Write a function named `palindrome_words` that takes a single parameter, which is a text. In the text, words are
separated by commas (`,`). The function should determine:

- How many palindrome words are there (words that read the same backward as forward, e.g., "kayak", "civic") that:
    * consist of at least 4 characters
    * have all uppercase letters!

If the function receives a parameter that is not of string type or the text in the parameter is an empty string (text of
length 0), then the return value should be `-1`!
