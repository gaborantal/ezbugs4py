Write a function named `coordinate_transform` that transforms two-dimensional coordinates. The input to the function is a text and a tuple of x, y shift values as floating-point numbers. The string contains pairs of coordinates separated by spaces, with the values in the pairs separated by commas. The function should add the x value to the first element of the pairs and the y value to the second. Return the result as a string in the same format!
