Write a function named `n_grammer` that takes a text and an integer as parameters.
The function's task is to break the received text into pieces of the received integer length, then return a list
containing the integer-converted version of these sections.
In the case where the last section would be shorter than the expected length, fill it with the appropriate number of `0`
characters.
It should not be necessary to provide the number, in this case, produce sections of length 3.
